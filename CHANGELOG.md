## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-22

First public release, archived on Zenodo ([doi:10.5281/zenodo.20790416](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20790416)).
Accompanies the manuscript *"Robust Gradient-Free Circle Estimation for Motion-Blurred Clinical Video"* (The Visual Computer).

### Added

- Proposed CIBICA estimator and four baselines by their original inventors:
  Circle Hough Transform (Duda & Hart 1972), Randomized Hough Transform (Xu et al. 1990),
  Randomized Circle Detection (Chen & Chung 2001), and robust algebraic IRLS fitting (Qi et al. 2024).
- Unified `estimate()` API returning `(x_col, y_row, r)`, and a `cibica` command-line
  interface with one subcommand per method.
- General image-to-edge-points preprocessing and the 18 study configurations.
- 144-frame clinical example dataset in `data/`, kept separate from the package
  (not bundled into the wheel).
- Reproduction script (`scripts/run_experiment.py`) writing tables to
  `results/tables/` and figures to `results/figures/`.
